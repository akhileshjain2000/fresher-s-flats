    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p class="quote"> When we go to Noida for the further studies we have to face several problems .For the first time we have to leave our hometown and it was too far.We opted the college through counselling of AKTU.So college opting problem was solved but the major problem we have to face was to find perfect flat and partner.Bascially many sites in the market exist for providing flats but they don't give the feature for finding room partner .It is the saying that the atmosphere effects a lot in our career.</p>
    <p>In the first year, we stayed in the college hostel and we  have to face so many restrictions. The quality of food in the starting months was good but later it started decling day by day.The cost we paid in the hostel was too much but  according to the cost the facilaties was poor.Our parents were afraid as they have send their wards far away from their hometown .They do not want their wards to leave the college campus and go for other rented house and avoid talking to strangers.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="quote">When any child go for further studies or going for preparation we do not need to worry about partner and rooms available nearby.The major problems of freshers was solved because we make a site having both the facilaties of rooms/flats and partner.Before going far away from hometown we booked our rooms at affordable prices.The type of partner you want you have to chat with him/her and known his ups and downs so we do not face any problem in future. </p>
    <p>In future we have to develop app on freshers flats for become more comfortable for students.Our team has to be in contact with the person who will stay in flats and try to solve their issues as soon as possible.This is user friendly.We provide multiple features.If anyone want to associate with us than they can join our affilate program.We have to solve the problem of brokage charges totally in few years in the market.The main focus of this project is on freshers because sometimes they waste a month to solve these types of problems.</p>
